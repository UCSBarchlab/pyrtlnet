Implement quantized inference with `NumPy`_ and `fxpmath`_.

This does not use the :ref:`litert_inference` reference implementation.

This implements the equations in
`Quantization and Training of Neural Networks for Efficient Integer-Arithmetic-Only Inference`_.
All `Equation` references in documentation and code comments refer to equations in this
paper.

The first layer is quantized per-axis, which is not described in the paper above. See
`per-axis quantization`_ for details.

    outputs, utilizing the 8-bit output range as effectively as possible.
