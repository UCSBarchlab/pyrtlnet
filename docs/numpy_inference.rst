NumPy Inference
===============

This is a software re-implementation of :ref:`litert_inference` in `NumPy`_ and
`fxpmath`_. This implementation is useful for understanding quantization math
before moving on to a hardware implementation in :ref:`pyrtl_inference`.

It produces the same output tensors as :ref:`litert_inference` and
:ref:`pyrtl_inference`.
